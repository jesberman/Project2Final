# Project2Final

This was a group project, designed to serve as a platform that would connect financial advisors with potential clients.  The ideas was that financial advisors and clients would be able to fill out separate profiles.  Then, the website would provide recommendations for certain adivsors to be matched to certain clients, based on the profiles that each  person would fill out.

While the front-end works effectively, the back-end, unfortunately, was never able to be fully implemented.  I apologize that this issue was not resolved.
